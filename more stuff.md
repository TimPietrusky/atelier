- feat(node/image): right now we open the left panel when we click on an image, but this totally sucks. when i click on it i can select it, when it is selected the image nav is always there, but we move the "settings" icon also in here, so only then the left panel opens / closes again when clicked on that settings button, you feel me? it is super annoying to click around in the list and then the fucking left panel opens. i want a flawless and always same way to handle the same thing everywhere, you feel me? right now we have the left panel for the actual image node only when we click on settings, this is the way and most distract free
- feat(lightbox): i want the controls not in the top right of the lightbox, use the same size and style and order that we have in all the image lists on the image itself, so we have a constant experience. also move the arrows next to the image left and right, so close to it, with a much larger size for better accessibility
